            Our mission is to provide a Diablo II experience that is both familiar and new. We aim to keep the core
            gameplay of Diablo II intact while adding new features and content to the game. We want to provide a fresh
            experience for players who have played Diablo II for years, while also providing a fun and engaging
            experience for new players.

            Everything we do, regardless if that is the D2R Files themselves or any of the tooling we build, is open
            source. We believe that the community should have the ability to see and modify the code that runs the mod.
            We also believe that the community should have the ability to contribute to the mod and help shape its
            future.
